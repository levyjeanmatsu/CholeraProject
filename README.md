## Cholera Project 

For the ICS 484 (Data Visualization) course I took during the Fall 2020 semester. For this project, I created a dashboard about the Cholera outbreaks in London during 1854. In order to create this dashboard, I learned how to create basic charts and graphs with the plotly.js framework (https://plotly.com/) and a map with Mapbox (https://www.mapbox.com/). 

The dashboard can be found [here](https://levyjeanmatsu.github.io/CholeraProject/).
