    <p>
      This table shows data from the UK census in 1851. It categorizes UK's population by gender and age group. It shows both, the total amount of people belonging to each age group as well as the amount of males and females in each age group.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below, the same data is represented in pie chart and bar chart form. From the data we can see that younger age groups made up most of the UK population at that time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This last pie chart below shows the total female and male population of the 1851 UK census. From the data, we see that UK's population at the time was almost equal, with there being slightly more females than males.

When you hover over each slice, it will say the percentage of the male population that falls into that age group and the amount of males in that age group.
