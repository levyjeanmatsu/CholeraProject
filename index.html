<div id='attackTable'></div>
<p>
  The table above contains data collected on the Cholera outbreak in London in 1854. More specifically, it shows the attacks and deaths per day, and the cumulative attacks and deaths up until that date. An attack is when someone exhibits symptoms of Cholera.
</p>

<div id='choleraLine' ></div>
<script src="deathsAndAttacks.js"></script>

<p>
  The scatter line plot above features the same information we saw in the table we had seen before. On the x-axis is the date in month-day format. On the y-axis is the amount of cases per day. The two green lines represents attacks, with the lighter green line representing the attacks that were recorded on that date and the darker green line represents the cumulative attacks. Similarly, the red lines represent deaths where the lighter red line is the deaths recorded on that date and the darker red line represents the cumulative deaths.
</p>

<div id='naplesTable'></div>
<script src="naplesData.js"></script>
<p>
  This table shows the male and female deaths in Naples in the period 1884 through 1911. The number under the 'Female' and 'Male' columns is the amount of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants of that age group.
</p>
<div id='censusTable'></div>
<p>
  This table shows data from the UK census in 1851. It categorizes UK's population by gender and age group. It shows both, the total amount of people belonging to each age group as well as the amount of males and females in each age group.
</p>

<div id='malePie'></div>
<p>
  This pie chart is a representation of UK's male population in 1851. Each "slice" is a different age group. Each slice is labeled by the age group it represents. When you hover over each slice, it will say the percentage of the male population that falls into that age group and the amount of males in that age group.
</p>
<div id='femalePie'></div>

<p>
  This pie chart is a representation of UK's female population in 1851. Each "slice" is a different age group. Each slice is labeled by the age group it represents. When you hover over each slice, it will say the percentage of the female population that falls into that age group and the amount of males in that age group.
</p>

<div id='maleBar'></div>
<p>
  This bar chart is another representation of UK's male population in 1851. On the x-axis is the different age groups the populations were divided into. On the y-axis is the amount of people within that age group. If you hover over each bar, it will tell you the exact amount of people in that age group.
</p>
<div id='femaleBar'></div>
<p>
  This bar chart is another representation of UK's female population in 1851. On the x-axis is the different age groups the populations were divided into. On the y-axis is the amount of women within that age group. If you hover over each bar, it will tell you the exact amount of women in that age group.
</p>
<div id='totalPie'></div>
<p>
  This pie chart shows the total female and male population of the 1851 UK census. The green slice represents males while the purple slice represents females.

<p>Lastly, I created a map of the Cholera outbreak in 1854. During the Cholera outbreak, John Snow (a physician) was studying the cause and he hypothesized it was due to contaminated water from the pumps. This theory was supported by his mapping of the cases, which showed they clustered around a pump located on Broad street. </p>

<p>
  My map differs slightly from the original due to the changes made to the Soho neighborhood since 1854. The red circles represents the location of a deaths due to Cholera and the blue pins represent the location of a water pump.
