      The table and bar chart above shows the male and female deaths due to cholera in Naples from 1884 through 1911. The number under the 'Female' and 'Male' columns is the amount of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants of that age group.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the data we can see that for both male and females, the amount of deaths increase with age. This shows that elderly was more at risk for severe illness.
